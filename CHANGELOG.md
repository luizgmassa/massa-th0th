- `docs/removed-features.md` documenting intentionally removed features (commit 5547afc)
- OS-level sandbox wrapper for executor (macOS seatbelt + Linux Docker, default `auto`)
- `format: json_schema` constrained decoding for Ollama structured LLM calls
- Web UI write mode (memory edit/delete + proposal approve/reject, gated by `MASSA_TH0TH_WEB_WRITE_MODE=true`)
- Web UI markdown rendering (`marked` + `DOMPurify` with XSS prevention)
- Web UI SSE real-time updates for dashboard + memory list
- Hook deadline breadcrumb-on-fire observability in `massa-th0th-hook`
- Native Codex plugin bundle (`apps/codex-plugin/`) with manifest, skills, hooks, MCP, and idempotent installer
- Native Cursor plugin bundle (`apps/cursor-plugin/`) with manifest, skills, hooks, MCP, agents, and idempotent installer
- `pre-tool-use` event added to shared hook binary `EVENT_MAP` for Codex/Cursor parity
- Claude Code `install.sh` hooks auto-write (array-append, idempotent)
- Root `install.sh` plugin menu extended to all four tools (Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode)
- `FEATURES.md` — complete feature reference (23 features, 52-tool roster, config tables, structural indexing detail)
- Deconfliction hints in `install-agents.ts` for Claude, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode

### Changed

- README consolidated: removed VSCode section, merged 4 plugin sections into one table, replaced duplicated tables with links to FEATURES.md
- TODO.md updated: multi-language tree-sitter marked COMPLETE, json_schema marked shipped, Codex+Cursor plugin parity added
- Architecture tree tool count corrected 47 → 52

- `local-health-checker.ts` now reads `config.get("embedding").model` instead of hardcoding `nomic-embed-text:latest`
- Executor sandbox defaults to `auto` (uses sandbox if available, falls back to best-effort)

### Removed

- Stale `compression.llm` deprecated alias reference from README.md (code already dropped in `da4c60f`)

### Fixed

- LLM/embedding model defaults now consistent across config, health-checker, and docs
